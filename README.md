## Product List

This project has been created by a student at Parsity, an online software engineering course. The work in this repository is wholly of the student based on a sample starter project that can be accessed by looking at the repository that this project forks.

This full stack application consists of using React.js on the front end and MongoDB with Node.js and Express on the backend with Next.js.

To begin running the application, use "mongod" to begin running the server, followed by "npm run dev" in a separate terminal window to run React and let Node begin listening. If these both successfully run, open "localhost:3000" to view the main page.

If there is no data displayed, you may need to generate fake data first. Do this by opening "localhost:8000/generate-fake-data". You will receive a message that the fake data was successfully generated. Return to "localhost:3000" to view the data generated.
